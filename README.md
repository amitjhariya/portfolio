This is a portfolio website built using Next.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building server-rendered React applications. It is a statically generated site and will be fast and performant. The portfolio showcases my past and current projects, with information about the technologies and skills used in each one. Feel free to take a look around and if you have any questions or would like to work together, please don't hesitate to reach out!
